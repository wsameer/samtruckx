Build an application in React JS with following features using a mock API server (https://reqres.in)

## Features
- User authentication using React hooks, Context API and `useReducer`
- User registration using React hooks, Context API and `useReducer`
- Session and Auth token management using localstorage

## Assumptions
- The apps only shows the fields which the API is returning.
- Create New Customer API does not actually modifies the backend. Hence the new customers won't persist.
- Same goes for Update and Dlete Customer API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
